# Hello-World

Xolisile Here

I'm a travel junkie who loves to experience all the beautiful things life has to offer. I enjoy the outdoors the most, especially hiking. 
I'm also a bookworm, I love studying, like they say, knolwedge is power. But I don't only just do academics, I like getting lost in a good read as well.
